# Getting Started

When you want to run these jupyter notebooks locally, here's some tips for making that work in VS Code:

1. Create a virtual environment

    ```shell
    % python -m venv ./.venv
    ```

1. Activate the virtual environment

    ```shell
    % source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

1. Confirm that it's activated properly:

    ```shell
    % python in_venv.py
    True
    ```

1. Install the requirements

    ```shell
    % pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
